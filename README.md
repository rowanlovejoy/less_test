## Launching on a local dev server

1. Run 'npm install'
2. Run 'npm run start'. This launches the app on a local Snowpack dev server; a new tab should open in your default browser with the app running. If this doesn't happen, once the dev server has started, the app should be accessible locally on localhost:8080.
